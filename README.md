Ticket Tales
TicketTales: A ticketing app that offers an easy and convenient way to book seats for various shows. With a user-friendly interface, the app allows users to browse upcoming events, select their preferred seats, and make secure payments all in one place. Whether you're looking to catch a play, a concert, or a comedy show, TicketTales has you covered.

Ticket Tales is a web application that allows users to book and manage movie tickets online. It is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and uses Jinja2 templates for frontend development.

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, which helps to separate the presentation layer from the business logic and data storage. The Model represents the database schema and operations, the View is responsible for rendering the HTML pages, and the Controller handles the user input and business logic.

Ticket Tales also features a RESTful API, which allows for easy integration with other systems. The API is built using Flask-RESTful, which is an extension that makes it easy to build RESTful APIs with Flask. The API uses JSON as the data format and supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all the resources.

The technologies used in Ticket Tales include Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Flask, Flask-RESTful, SQL-Alchemy, and Flask-CORS. Python is used as the main programming language, while HTML and CSS are used for frontend development. SQLite is used as the database management system, and Flask is used as the web framework. Flask-RESTful is used to build the RESTful API, and SQL-Alchemy is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. Flask-CORS is used to enable cross-origin resource sharing.

API Design
The Ticket Tales API follows RESTful principles and supports CRUD operations for the following resources:

Users
Venues
Shows
Bookings
The API uses the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform the CRUD operations. The endpoints are designed to be self-explanatory and follow the standard RESTful conventions.

Here are some examples of the API endpoints:

bash
GET /api/users/1
POST /api/users
PUT /api/users/1
DELETE /api/users/1

GET /api/venues/1
POST /api/venues
PUT /api/venues/1
DELETE /api/venues/1

GET /api/shows/1
POST /api/shows
PUT /api/shows/1
DELETE /api/shows/1

GET /api/bookings/1
POST /api/bookings
PUT /api/bookings/1
DELETE /api/bookings/1
